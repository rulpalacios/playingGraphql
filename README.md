# Sample GraphQL Project with Ruby on Rails

## Project Description
This project is an example of how to use GraphQL with Ruby on Rails.

## Requirements
- Ruby 3.2.2
- Rails 7.0.8

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git`
2. Install the gems: `bundle install`
3. Create and migrate the database: `rails db:create && rails db:migrate`

## Running Tests
Run the tests using RSpec:
```bash
rspec
```

## Using GraphQL
You can interact with the GraphQL API using GraphiQL or by making queries and mutations. Here's an example of how to create a character:
```graphql
mutation {
  createCharacter(input: {
    name: "Krilin",
    race: "Human",
    powerLevel: 1000,
    universeId: 1
  }) {
    character {
      id
      name
      race
      powerLevel
      universe {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    errors
  }
}
```

## Project Structure
The project structure follows the typical Ruby on Rails convention with models, controllers, mutations, queries, etc.
```lua
|-- app
|   |-- controllers
|   |-- models
|   |-- graphql
|       |-- mutations
|       |-- queries
|       |-- types
|-- config
|-- db
|-- ...
```
